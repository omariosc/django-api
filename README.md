This repository contains code for Coursework 2 of the COMP3011 Web Services & Web Data module.

## Tasks

- Implement the web service on your local machine and fully test its operation.
- Once you are satisfied with your service, upload it to python anywhere.
- Coordinate with other team members to make sure that your service is communicating
- properly with other services and client applications.
- Collectively test the entire system with other team members.

- Data Integration: The central directory service must integrate with other airline systems and services to provide seamless information exchange and connectivity.
- Performance: The central directory service must have a fast response time and low latency to ensure a positive user experience.

## Advanced Requirements

- Secure Access: The central directory service must only be accessible by authorised users, with appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access.
- Performance: The central directory service must have a fast response time and low latency to ensure a positive user experience.
- Scalability: The central directory service must be scalable to handle a high volume of requests from other services.
